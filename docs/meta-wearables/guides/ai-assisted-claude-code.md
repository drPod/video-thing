# Claude Code

Updated: Mar 12, 2026

## Overview

[Claude Code⁠](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) auto-discovers the `.claude/` directory when you open a project that contains it. No manual configuration is required.

Once loaded, Claude Code has full context on the SDK and can help you:

-   Set up your project and adding DAT SDK dependencies
-   Implement camera streaming, session lifecycle, and permissions
-   Write tests with Mock Device Kit
-   Debug common integration issues

## Setup

If you cloned the SDK repo, the `.claude/` directory is already included. Otherwise, install it with the CLI:

./install\-skills.sh claude

Or install remotely:

iOS:

curl \-sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-ios/main/install-skills.sh | bash -s claude

Android:

curl \-sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-android/main/install-skills.sh | bash -s claude

## Usage

Start Claude Code in your project directory:

claude

You can then ask it about any DAT SDK topic, have it implement a specific app functionality, or make it write tests — the skills are already loaded:

\> How do I set up camera streaming in my Android app?
> Write a test for my session lifecycle using MockDeviceKit

## Adding the API reference

The project-level config covers integration patterns and best practices. To also include the full API reference, paste the llms.txt URL directly into your Claude Code prompt:

\> Using https://wearables.developer.meta.com/llms.txt?full=true as reference, what parameters does StreamSession accept?

Or add it to your `.claude/CLAUDE.md` so it loads automatically:

## API Reference  
Fetch https://wearables.developer.meta.com/llms.txt?full=true for the Wearables DAT SDK API reference.  
  

Claude Code will fetch and read the URL contents automatically when you include it in your prompt.
